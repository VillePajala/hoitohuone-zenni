# Complete API Migration Project

## Overview

This PR completes the migration of all API endpoints to our new standardized format. The migration is now 100% complete with 23 out of 23 endpoints successfully migrated.

## Key Changes

1. **Migrated Remaining Endpoints**:
   - `/api/admin/services/reorder` - Implemented with forwarding to the PATCH endpoint
   - `/api/admin/bookings/debug` - Added authentication and comprehensive database debugging output
   - `/api/admin/bookings/debug-data` - Created static data provider for frontend testing
   - `/api/bookings` - Resolved cookie handling issues
   - `/api/test-email-config` - Resolved cookie handling issues

2. **Created Cookie Service**:
   - Implemented a robust CookieService utility to address cookie handling in Next.js App Router
   - Works in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts
   - Provides consistent API for getting and setting cookies
   - Includes fallback mechanisms for different contexts

3. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Created detailed implementation summary
   - Updated migration tracker to 100% completion
   - Added CookieService usage guide

## Technical Details

### Cookie Handling Solution

The primary challenge resolved in this PR was handling cookies in middleware-wrapped handlers. 
The Next.js `cookies()` function sometimes returns a Promise instead of the expected synchronous object when used within middleware.

Our solution:
1. Created a new `CookieService` utility that tries multiple approaches to get cookie values
2. Directly reads from request headers as a fallback if the cookies() API fails
3. Provides helper methods for common cookie operations
4. Includes comprehensive logging for debugging

### Implementation Changes

The last endpoints migrated follow our standardized pattern:
- Handler middleware for consistent request parsing
- Structured logging with request ID tracking
- Standardized response formatting
- Type-safe validation
- Proper error handling

## Testing

Manually tested all migrated endpoints and verified:
- Cookie reading and writing functionality
- Authentication works correctly
- Response formats are consistent
- Error handling behaves as expected

## Next Steps

With the migration complete, we can now focus on:
1. Comprehensive API documentation
2. Creating integration tests for all endpoints
3. Unit tests for the API utilities
