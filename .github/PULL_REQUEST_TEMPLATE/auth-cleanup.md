# Authentication System Cleanup

## Description
This PR cleans up deprecated authentication utilities as part of the Authentication Phase 2 implementation plan.

## Changes
- [ ] Added deprecation warnings to old utilities 
- [ ] Created compatibility shims for backward compatibility
- [ ] Removed deprecated exports from barrel files
- [ ] Complete removal of deprecated authentication utilities
- [ ] Updated documentation to reflect changes

## Testing
- [ ] Verified all API routes still work with the new authentication system
- [ ] Checked for any runtime errors related to the deprecated utilities
- [ ] Confirmed all tests pass with deprecated code removed

## Migration Impact
- [ ] Low: Only marking code as deprecated, no functional changes
- [ ] Medium: Removing exports but providing compatibility layer
- [ ] High: Complete removal of deprecated code

## Rollback Plan
In case of issues:
1. Identify which removed utility is causing problems
2. Restore the specific utility with appropriate warnings
3. Create a new PR to properly migrate affected code
