# PostgreSQL Migration Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for migrating the Hoitohuone Zenni booking system from SQLite to PostgreSQL (via Supabase) once VPN restrictions are resolved. The migration will be performed with minimal downtime and maximum data integrity.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the migration, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **VPN Restrictions Resolved**
   - Confirm that VPN restrictions allowing access to Supabase are resolved
   - Test connectivity to Supabase from development environment

2. **Supabase Account Setup**
   - Create a Supabase account and project
   - Note the connection details (host, port, database name, username, password)
   - Set up appropriate security settings and firewall rules

3. **Development Environment Preparation**
   - Create a separate branch for migration work
   - Set up dual database configuration capability in the application
   - Create and test database backup scripts

4. **Testing Environment**
   - Set up a staging environment that mirrors production
   - Configure the environment to use both SQLite and PostgreSQL for testing

## Pre-Migration Tasks

1. **Schema Compatibility Review**
   - Review current schema against PostgreSQL best practices
   - Implement the optimizations outlined in the [Database Schema Decisions](database-schema-decisions.md) document
   - Update any SQLite-specific code to be database-agnostic

2. **Data Audit**
   - Perform a complete data audit to identify any inconsistencies
   - Validate data integrity and fix any issues in the current database
   - Document any special data formats or structures that might need transformation

3. **Query Analysis**
   - Analyze current query patterns for potential performance issues in PostgreSQL
   - Optimize inefficient queries
   - Document queries that will need special attention during migration

4. **Application Updates**
   - Update Prisma schema with PostgreSQL-specific optimizations
   - Modify any direct SQL queries to work with PostgreSQL
   - Update data access layer to properly handle PostgreSQL-specific features

5. **Create Migration Scripts**
   - Develop data export scripts from SQLite
   - Create data transformation scripts if needed
   - Develop data import scripts for PostgreSQL
   - Create verification scripts to validate data integrity after migration

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 Weeks Before Migration)

1. **Supabase Setup**
   - Create the necessary database in Supabase
   - Set up proper user permissions and access controls
   - Configure backups and monitoring

2. **Schema Migration**
   - Update the Prisma schema for PostgreSQL
   - Generate the PostgreSQL migrations using Prisma
   - Apply the migrations to the Supabase database
   - Verify schema creation

3. **Test Migration**
   - Perform a full test migration with a copy of production data
   - Measure migration time and resource usage
   - Validate data integrity after test migration
   - Run application tests against the migrated database

### Phase 2: Migration Execution (Migration Day)

1. **Preparation**
   - Announce scheduled maintenance window
   - Set up application in read-only mode if possible
   - Perform final backup of SQLite database

2. **Data Migration**
   - Export data from SQLite
   - Transform data if necessary
   - Import data into PostgreSQL
   - Verify data counts and integrity

3. **Connection Switching**
   - Update environment variables to point to PostgreSQL
   - Deploy application with updated configuration
   - Verify connectivity and functionality

4. **Verification**
   - Run data integrity checks
   - Test critical application functions
   - Monitor application performance and error rates

### Phase 3: Post-Migration (1-2 Days After Migration)

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze query performance in the production environment
   - Add additional indexes as needed
   - Optimize slow queries
   - Adjust connection pooling settings

2. **Data Verification**
   - Perform comprehensive data validation
   - Compare key metrics between old and new systems
   - Ensure all relationships and constraints are working correctly

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up PostgreSQL-specific monitoring
   - Configure alerts for database issues
   - Monitor connection pool usage
   - Track query performance metrics

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues during migration, the following rollback plan should be executed:

1. **Decision Criteria**
   - Define clear criteria for when to initiate rollback
   - Assign decision-making authority to specific team members

2. **Rollback Process**
   - Revert environment variables to SQLite configuration
   - Deploy application with original configuration
   - Verify functionality with SQLite database
   - Announce extended maintenance if needed

3. **Post-Rollback Analysis**
   - Document issues that triggered rollback
   - Analyze and fix problems in the development environment
   - Schedule new migration attempt after issues are resolved

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Data loss during migration | Low | High | Multiple backups, verification scripts, dry run |
| Schema compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing in staging environment |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Query optimization, proper indexing, monitoring |
| Extended downtime | Low | High | Well-tested migration scripts, rollback plan |
| Connection issues to Supabase | Medium | High | Pre-test connectivity, backup connection options |

## Timeline

| Task | Duration | Dependencies |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Prerequisites | 1 week | VPN restrictions resolved |
| Pre-Migration Tasks | 2 weeks | Prerequisites completed |
| Phase 1: Preparation | 1-2 weeks | Pre-Migration Tasks completed |
| Phase 2: Migration Execution | 1 day | Phase 1 completed |
| Phase 3: Post-Migration | 1-2 days | Phase 2 completed |

## Documentation Updates

After successful migration, update the following documentation:

1. **Database Documentation**
   - Update schema documentation to reflect PostgreSQL structure
   - Document PostgreSQL-specific optimizations
   - Update connection information and environment variables

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Update setup instructions for new developers
   - Document PostgreSQL-specific development considerations
   - Update database backup and restore procedures

3. **Operations Documentation**
   - Document monitoring procedures
   - Update backup schedule and retention policy
   - Document connection pooling settings and management

## Training

Provide training for the development and operations teams:

1. **Developer Training**
   - PostgreSQL basics and best practices
   - Prisma usage with PostgreSQL
   - Debugging common PostgreSQL issues

2. **Operations Training**
   - PostgreSQL monitoring and maintenance
   - Backup and restore procedures
   - Scaling and performance optimization

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a comprehensive approach to migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL (via Supabase). By following this structured process, we can ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to users while maintaining data integrity and application functionality.

The plan can be adjusted based on specific project needs and timelines, but the core principles of thorough preparation, testing, and verification should be maintained.
