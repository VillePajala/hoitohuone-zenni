## Architecture Improvements

Based on a comprehensive analysis of the codebase, the following architectural improvements are recommended to enhance maintainability, performance, and scalability:

### Authentication Enhancements
1. **Consolidate Authentication Logic**
   - Merge overlapping functionality between AuthContext and useAdminAuth hook
   - Simplify token refresh mechanism to reduce complexity
   - Implement proper session management instead of manually tracking token expiry

2. **Standardize Auth Flow**
   - Create clear separation between authentication strategies for different parts of the app
   - Improve error handling in authentication flows
   - Reduce redundant auth checks across components

### API Structure Optimization
1. **Standardize API Directory Structure**
   - Choose either src/api or src/app/api for route handlers (recommended: use app/api consistently)
   - Implement middleware for common API concerns
   - Create API versioning strategy for future-proofing

2. **Improve Request Handling**
   - Implement proper logging (replace excessive console.log statements)
   - Add request validation middleware
   - Create consistent response formatting across all endpoints

### Database Management Improvements
1. **Connection Optimization**
   - Implement connection pooling or persistent connections
   - Use transactions for related database operations
   - Consider migrating to PostgreSQL for production (currently using SQLite)

2. **Data Access Layer**
   - Implement repository pattern to abstract database access
   - Create service classes to centralize business logic
   - Add robust data validation before database operations

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement server-side caching for frequently accessed data
   - Use static generation for suitable pages
   - Add appropriate cache headers for API responses

2. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**
   - Review and optimize component bundling
   - Implement code splitting for admin panel
   - Use dynamic imports for heavy components

### General Architecture
1. **Code Organization**
   - Standardize naming conventions across routes and components
   - Extract duplicate logic to shared utilities
   - Implement consistent error handling strategy

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Create comprehensive test strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Implement test coverage reporting
   - Set up CI pipeline for automated testing

The implementation of these improvements should be prioritized based on current development goals and timelines. Consider implementing critical items first, such as database connection optimization and API structure standardization.
