# Next Steps for Hoitohuone Zenni Booking System

This document outlines the next steps for the Hoitohuone Zenni booking system development, arranged in priority order. It's been updated to reflect the current state of the project as of the latest pull from March 2024.

## Priority 1: Architecture Improvements (Critical)

While the booking system is functional, there are critical architectural improvements needed to ensure stability, maintainability, and scalability:

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Continue using SQLite with Prisma for the current development phase
   - Implement proper error handling for database operations
   - Add transactions for related database operations
   - Ensure schema decisions are compatible with future PostgreSQL migration
   - **Note**: Migration to PostgreSQL/Supabase has been postponed due to VPN restrictions

2. **Authentication Consolidation**
   - Merge overlapping functionality between AuthContext and useAdminAuth hook
   - Simplify token refresh mechanism to reduce complexity
   - Implement proper session management instead of manually tracking token expiry
   - Improve error handling in authentication flows

3. **API Structure Standardization**
   - Choose either src/api or src/app/api for route handlers (recommended: use app/api consistently)
   - Implement middleware for common API concerns (validation, error handling, authentication)
   - Create standardized response formatting across all endpoints
   - Replace excessive console.log statements with proper logging system

4. **Data Access Layer Improvement**
   - Implement repository pattern to abstract database access
   - Create service classes to centralize business logic
   - Add robust data validation before database operations
   - Ensure database access patterns will work with both SQLite and PostgreSQL

## Priority 2: Enhance Current Features

These improvements build upon existing functionality to provide a more complete and polished experience:

### Availability Management System
- Improve visual feedback for time slot conflicts
- Enhance blocked dates interface with time range blocking
- Create visual calendar showing all bookings and availability
- Implement recurring blocked dates functionality
- Add conflict detection and resolution system

### Booking Management
- Add advanced filtering options (by date range, service, status)
- Implement search functionality for bookings
- Create sorting options for booking lists
- Add pagination for large booking lists
- Implement booking editing and rescheduling functionality
- Create booking notes system

### Services Management
- Add image upload capability for service thumbnails
- Implement rich text editor for service descriptions
- Add service categories functionality
- Track service popularity and revenue
- Enhance mobile experience for service management

## Priority 3: Testing and Quality Assurance

Ensuring the reliability and stability of the booking system is critical:

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Implement end-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright
   - Create unit tests for API endpoints and critical components
   - Add integration tests for key features
   - Set up test coverage reporting

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement server-side caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add appropriate cache headers for API responses
   - Use static generation for suitable pages
   - Implement code splitting for admin panel
   - Add performance monitoring

3. **Security Audit**
   - Review authentication and authorization implementations
   - Check for common security vulnerabilities
   - Add CSRF protection for all forms
   - Implement proper security headers

## Priority 4: Admin Dashboard Enhancements

Improving the admin experience with better insights and tools:

1. **Dashboard Visualization**
   - Create statistics widgets (bookings, revenue)
   - Add upcoming bookings list
   - Implement booking pattern charts
   - Add revenue forecasting

2. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Create exportable reports (CSV, PDF)
   - Implement calendar export (iCal format)
   - Add email report scheduling
   - Create custom report builder

3. **Quick Access Functions**
   - Add shortcuts to common tasks
   - Implement notification center
   - Create search functionality across all admin sections
   - Add recent activity log

## Priority 5: Content and SEO Finalization

Preparing for production deployment:

1. **Content Completion**
   - Add professional images for services and pages
   - Optimize all images for web performance
   - Complete all content translations
   - Review and finalize copy across all pages

2. **SEO Optimization**
   - Complete metadata implementation
   - Add business details to structured data
   - Implement robots.txt and sitemap.xml
   - Set up Google site verification
   - Review all image alt tags

## Priority 6: Compliance and Legal

Ensuring legal compliance for the site:

1. **GDPR Compliance**
   - Implement cookie consent system
   - Create privacy policy page
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Add data export/deletion functionality

2. **Legal Documentation**
   - Create terms of service page
   - Add booking cancellation policy
   - Implement cookie policy
   - Create accessibility statement

## Priority 7: Production Preparation

Final steps before production deployment:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Configure production environment
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement monitoring system
   - Create backup strategy
   - Set up error tracking

2. **Analytics Implementation**
   - Set up Google Analytics
   - Configure conversion tracking
   - Implement user behavior tracking
   - Create performance monitoring

## Priority 8: Database Migration and Future Enhancements

After initial release and when VPN restrictions allow:

1. **PostgreSQL/Supabase Migration**
   - Implement migration from SQLite to Supabase PostgreSQL
   - Configure connection pooling
   - Test all functionality after migration
   - Optimize queries for PostgreSQL
   - Set up proper backup and recovery procedures

2. **Additional Modules**
   - Newsletter integration
   - Blog/News section
