## Next Steps in Migration Process

All endpoints have been successfully migrated to the new standardized API format! 

The last part of the project includes:

1. **Documentation**:
   - Create API documentation for all migrated endpoints
   - Document the new API utilities and how to use them

2. **Testing**:
   - Create integration tests for the migrated endpoints
   - Unit tests for the API utilities

## Migration Progress Summary

- **Total Endpoints**: 23
- **Completed**: 23 (100%)
- **In Progress**: 0 (0%)
- **Planned**: 0 (0%)

## Challenges and Learnings

- The new API utilities significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed
- Standardized error handling improves consistency across the API
- Request ID tracking enhances logging and debugging capabilities
- Middleware integration simplifies common concerns like logging and error handling
- Type-safe validation enhances reliability and provides better error messages for clients
- Converting from mock implementations to real data requires careful handling of database queries
- Service-specific customization (like duration) can be easily incorporated into the standardized pattern
- Cookie handling in Next.js App Router with the new API utilities requires additional investigation
- Multi-method endpoints (GET/POST) can be cleanly implemented with separate handler functions
- Authentication handling across different request types requires a flexible approach
- TypeScript type definitions for handler context objects need improvement
