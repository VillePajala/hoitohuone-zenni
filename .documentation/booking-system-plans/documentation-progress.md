## Next Steps

The next document to be created is the Implementation Roadmap, which will outline the phased approach with milestones and deliverables.

## Document Dependencies

Some documents may depend on others being completed first. The general recommended sequence is:

1. Requirements Specification
2. System Architecture Document
3. Database Schema Design
4. API Specification & User Flow Documentation (can be worked on in parallel)
5. UI/UX Wireframes
6. Implementation Roadmap
7. Integration Guidelines, Security Plan, Testing Strategy (can be worked on in parallel)
8. Deployment and Scaling Plan
9. Maintenance Documentation
