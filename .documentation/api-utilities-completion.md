# API Utilities Implementation

This document summarizes the completion of Phase 1 of the API structure standardization plan, specifically the creation of core API utilities.

## Implemented Utilities

The following utilities have been implemented in the `src/lib/api` directory:

### 1. Structured Logging (`logging.ts`)

A comprehensive logging utility that replaces ad-hoc `console.log` statements with structured logging:

- Supports multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Provides context support for rich logging data
- Formats logs as JSON for easier parsing
- Adjusts log level based on environment (development vs production)
- Offers exception logging with stack traces

### 2. Error Handling (`errorHandling.ts`)

A standardized error handling mechanism:

- Defines standard error codes and messages
- Maps errors to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Handles common error types (including Prisma errors)
- Provides consistent error response formatting
- Includes convenience functions for common error types (not found, unauthorized, etc.)

### 3. Response Formatting (`responseFormatting.ts`)

Utilities for creating standardized API responses:

- Consistent response structure with data and metadata
- Support for pagination metadata
- Standard HTTP headers
- Caching directives
- Status code handling

### 4. Request Validation (`validation.ts`)

A flexible validation system that works without external dependencies:

- Type checking for request data
- Parameter validation for query params and JSON bodies
- Middleware integration for automatic validation
- Support for object, string, number, boolean, and array validation
- Detailed validation error messages

### 5. Middleware (`middleware.ts`)

Composable middleware functions:

- Request ID generation
- Request/response logging
- Error handling
- CORS headers
- Request method validation
- Middleware composition utilities

### 6. Base Handler (`baseHandler.ts`)

Factory functions for creating standardized API routes:

- Handlers for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Integration with validation
- Standardized response formatting
- Error handling
- Authentication hooks

### 7. Centralized Exports (`index.ts`)

A single export point for all API utilities to simplify imports.

## Sample Implementation

A sample implementation has been created in `src/app/api/example/route.ts` to demonstrate how to use these utilities:

- GET handler with query parameter validation
- POST handler with request body validation
- Standardized success responses

## Next Steps

With the core utilities in place, we can now proceed to Phase 2 of the API structure standardization plan:

1. Begin catalog and analysis of existing endpoints
2. Create a migration plan for each endpoint
3. Start migrating simpler endpoints to the new structure
4. Implement more advanced features like request validation and enhanced logging
5. Update documentation as we progress

## Benefits

The implementation of these utilities provides immediate benefits:

- Consistent error handling across all API endpoints
- Structured logging for better debugging and monitoring
- Type-safe request validation
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved developer experience through standardized patterns
- Better maintainability of the codebase
